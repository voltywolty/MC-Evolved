# ShrineMC

This is the server plugin for my server ShrineMC.

I have decided to have this repository public for those who wish to have something similar to what I have. This plugin includes a start game and end game function, as well as a countdown bar for when the game is about to start. Please note that you will need to modify this to your liking, but you are welcome to use it for your server.
